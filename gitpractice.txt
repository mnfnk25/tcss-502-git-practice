Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (also known as Alice in Wonderland) is an 1865 English children's novel by Lewis Carroll, 
a mathematics don at the University of Oxford. It details the story of a girl named Alice who falls through a rabbit hole into 
a fantasy world of anthropomorphic creatures. It is seen as an example of the literary nonsense genre. The artist John Tenniel 
provided 42 wood-engraved illustrations for the book. It received positive reviews upon release and is now one of the best-known 
works of Victorian literature; its narrative, structure, characters and imagery have had a widespread influence on popular culture 
and literature, especially in the fantasy genre.[1][2] It is credited as helping end an era of didacticism in children's 
literature, inaugurating an era in which writing for children aimed to "delight or entertain".[3] The tale plays with logic, 
giving the story lasting popularity with adults as well as with children.[4] The titular character Alice shares her name with 
Alice Liddell, a girl Carroll knew—scholars disagree about the extent to which the character was based upon her.[5][6]
The book has never been out of print and has been translated into 174 languages. Its legacy includes adaptations to screen, 
radio, visual art, ballet, opera, and musical theatre, as well as theme parks, board games and video games.[7] Carroll published
 a sequel in 1871 entitled Through the Looking-Glass and a shortened version for young children, The Nursery "Alice", in 1890.
